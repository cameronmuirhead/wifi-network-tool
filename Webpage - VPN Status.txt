                <p>Here are some <b>Recommendations</b> and an explanation on how VPNs can be used to improve security:<br><br>
                   The above function is used to detect if the user is on a VPN. This is an easy and affordable way to improve<br>
                   your security and privacy if you are required to use public Wi-Fi.<br><br>
                   <FONT COLOR="#008000"><b>Benefits:</b></FONT COLOR="#008000"> Security is the main feature that is desired from users<br>
                   when connecting to a VPN. Standard network traffic is available to others on a network as it is generally sent un-encrypted.<br>
                   By using a VPN, the traffic is sent over a secure and encrypted channel, between the clients device and the remote VPN server.<br>
                   This means that all of the traffic is difficult to intercept and read by an attacker. <br>
                   Details such as your IP address, location and online activity are all masked behind the VPN server you are connected to. This<br>
                   Increases privacy as well as keeping your personal credentials secure.<br>
                   There are also other benefits to using a VPN such as, access to websites and services that are restricted on the public Wi-Fi network.<br><br>
                   <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><b>Downsides:</b></FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> Sometimes while using a VPN you may experience slower connection speeds as<br>
                   all of your traffic is first sent to the VPN server and then re-directed to your original destination. There are some free VPNs out there<br>
                   however, most of the top used require a subscription charge which can add up over time. The free VPNs generally have a data limitation or<br>
                   restricted features.<br><br>

                   Although there are a couple of downsides to VPNs, the benefits heavily outweigh them. It is highly recommended to use a VPN if you are<br>
                   using public Wi-Fi, mainly for the security improvements listed above - even if this costs you a couple of pennies per month!<br>
