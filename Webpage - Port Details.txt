                <p>Here are some <b>Recommendations</b> and an explanation on how ports can affect a network:<br><br>
                   As you can see above, there are multiple 'ports' that have been detected as open.<br>
                   A port on the network is a virtual communication channel which data is sent and received through.<br>
                   Different services and applications use these ports, and can be exploited by attackers to gain<br>
                   unauthorized access or execute attacks against vulnerabilities.<br><br>
                   Some common ports you often find open are ones used by the Windows operating system [135,139]<br>
                   that have the purpose of file and print sharing, keep this in mind as attackers may see these<br>
                   ports being open and choose to take advantage of an exploit.<br>
                   Generally ports are open on a network for a reason, for example, HTTP [80] and HTTPS [443] allow<br>
                   us access to view this web page from the outside of the hosted environment<br>
                   It is difficult to say that a specific port itself is dangerous, however, be aware that a well<br>
                   restricted and secure network will not have all ports open to the entire outside world.<br><br>
                   A port scan is a bit like someone coming to your house to do a survey on how many entrances<br>
                   or exits they can find that would need to be covered by CCTV cameras. You would want to make<br>
                   sure that every door or window is visible and tracked in case of an attacker trying to enter.<br>
