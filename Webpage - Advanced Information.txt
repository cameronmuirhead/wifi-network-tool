                <p>Here are some <b>Recommendations</b> on the type of security you should aim for:<br><br>
                   In the advanced information above there is the security type listed. There are two types of security that a<br>
                   Wi-Fi network can come in.<br><br>
                   The signal strength above also indicates how strong your connection is to the device providing Wi-Fi access.<br>
                   A strong connection is anything -50 dBm and above. It is recommended that the signal strength should not be<br>
                   any lower than -70 dBm as this is the minimum required for basic web browsing and email delivery.<br><br> 

                   An <b>open</b> Wi-Fi network is an unsecured connection with no forms of encryption or security applied. This<br>
                   means that anyone within a suitable range, or strong enough 'signal' strength could connect to the network.<br>
                   Now understanding signal strength allows us to get a rough idea of how great of a distance you could be in order<br>
                   to carry out an attack on a Wi-Fi network. For example, have you ever attempted to log into a Wi-Fi network in a<br>
                   shopping centre and been bombarded with the number of Wi-Fi networks advertising themselves? This is something to <br>
                   keep in mind because although you may think you are the only individual in the area that could be connected, there<br>
                   could always be an attacker gaining access from the distance.<br><br>
                   A <b>private</b> Wi-Fi network is a secured, encrypted network that requires levels of security to connect. This means<br>
                   only users that have authenticated are authorized to join the network. This could be in the form of a password or even<br>
                   individuals credentials. One form of credential logging is captive portals. These are common in more secure public Wi-Fi<br>
                   networks, often found in hotels and airports. Upon connection to the network they greet you with a web page that requires<br>
                   the user to log in generally connecting an account or at minimum an e-mail address. Some of these networks would require<br>
                   a subscription or a purchase in order to get onto the network, which many attackers are not willing to do. There is<br>
                   no password to join as they use credentials, so only those authorized can access the network.<br><br>
