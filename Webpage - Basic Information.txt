                    <p>SSID <FONT COLOR="FF0000"><u>not found</u></FONT COLOR="FF0000"> in the WiGLE Stats database.</p>
                {% endif %}

                <p>Here are some <b>Recommendations</b> you should take given the Wi-Fi network you are currently connected to:<br>
                   <br>
                   If you are connected to a recognised SSID that has been found in WiGLE stats, then the network you are on is noted as the top 1000 common network names. <br>
                   This database holds a large amount of public Wi-Fi and general names that are found most commonly. This is something you should keep in mind when connecting <br>
                   to networks as leaving SSID names on default can be a good indicator of how secure the rest of the configuration is on the network you are joining.<br><br>
                   The security protocol above is also a <b>critical</b> factor that determines the encryption algorithm being used. Here is a brief summary of each type below:<br>
                                 (Note: I have colour coded these, RED being the worst - GREEN being the best.)<br><br>
                   <FONT COLOR="FF0000"><b>WEP:</b></FONT COLOR="FF0000"> Is the older security protocol that is still used in some networks today. It was introduced with the first wireless 802.11 networks, using a single key<br>
                        for encryption and decryption of the data. It is very widely known to be the one of the most insecure methods of encryption as there are available tools<br>
                        to crack it.<br><br>
                   <FONT COLOR="FFA500"><b>WPA:</b></FONT COLOR="FFA500"> The first version of WPA is designed to secure Wi-Fi networks. Specifically using the TKIP encryption<br>
                        algorithm which is an outdated and less secure compared to modern standards.<br><br> 
                   <FONT COLOR="6FFF69"><b>WPA2:</b></FONT COLOR="6FFF69"> This is the first reasonable choice of encryption as it is trickier to crack, although proven possible<br>
                        during the practical demonstration. WPA2 comes in two forms, personal and enterprise. WPA2-Personal is more commonly found on public networks as it uses<br>
                        a pre-shared key (containing a password) that passes authentication between the device and the network. This style can be vulnerable to brute force attacks<br>
                        as we showed earlier.<br>
                        WPA2-Enterprise uses a centralized authentication server which provides a higher level of security due to the users having to match login credentials.<br>
                        It does this through authentication methods such as RADIUS servers where each individual will have unique details to sign in.<br><br>
                   <FONT COLOR="008000"><b>WPA3:</b></FONT COLOR="008000"> This is the latest version of the WPA security protocol that provides numerous improvements to its<br>
                        predecessors. This includes: stronger encryption, higher levels of password-based authentication, improved protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.<br><br>
